#  Node.js Project Structure

```
    NodeJS and NPM.
    MVC architecture (Model, View, and Controllers).
    REST APIs.
```

## Node JS project structure is important
    It organizes the code into separate files, folders, and subfolders

    . Bundle similar logic in the same folder
    . The controllers should be thin
    . Separate the database logic and business logic
    . Use a Routes file to make API calls
    . Node Modules should be in the root folder
    . Environment Variables in .env file
    . gitignore file should be used to prevent unnecessary files to be shared
    . Test Files should be included next to the logic files
